This is cross-workspace web UI and search engine GCP, AWS, and Microsoft. 
In GCP, the workspace unit are Projects, which proliferate for lack of 
billing visibility. In AWS, the workspace unit are accounts, which proliferate to
scope IAM blast radius.

# Roadmap 

For now, we are focused on the search engine component. In the future,
we will encapsulate CRUD flows such as 'sane defaults' for otherwise unwieldy
web forms, especially in the case of GCP.
